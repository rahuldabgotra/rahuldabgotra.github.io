During my internship at Translab, I had the opportunity to work on several impactful projects:

- I developed and tested minor APIs using Spring Boot and Postman. These APIs encompassed CRUD operations, user authentication, and email functionality.
- I managed the infrastructure of Project KJS Cements using VMWare and Zoho platform. My responsibilities included ensuring seamless operations through effective System and Disk Management.
- I orchestrated Azure Cloud solutions for Project DGV. This involved configuring MySQL, Tomcat, and Sectona PAM on Linux servers. I was also responsible for resolving Azure Cloud issues efficiently, ensuring seamless project operations.
